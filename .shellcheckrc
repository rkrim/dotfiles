# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles project
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Configuration

# Disable specific checks that might be too strict for this project

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location.
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following: file not included in sources
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused. Verify use (or export if used externally).
# Useful for variables that are sourced by other scripts
disable=SC2034

# SC2154: Variable is referenced but not assigned
# Common in sourced files where variables are defined elsewhere
disable=SC2154

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Disabled for code brevity - splitting local var=$(cmd) into two lines is overly verbose
disable=SC2155

# SC2164: Use 'cd ... || exit' or 'cd ... || return' in case cd fails
# Sometimes we want to continue even if cd fails
# disable=SC2164

# You can enable specific optional checks:
# enable=avoid-nullary-conditions
